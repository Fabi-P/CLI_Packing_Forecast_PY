# Packing forecast CLI app

This Command Line Interface app helps creates a forecast report and a list of clothes that you should pack for a trip.

Using **Visual Crossing API**, the program creates a report with the temperature and weather conditions.
It then suggests the type of clothing most appropriate for the weather.
Both weather report and packing suggestions are written on a separate txt file.

Users will be asked for a destination and the dates of the trip.
